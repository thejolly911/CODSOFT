TASK 1

1. Generate a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100.

2. Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.

3. Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess
is correct, too high, or too low.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number.

You can incorporate additional details as follows:

5. Limit the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.
6. Add the option for multiple rounds, allowing the user to play again.
7. Display the user's score, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.

NUMBER GAME

TASK 2

1. Prompt the user to enter a text or provide a file to count the words.
2. Read the input text or file and store it in a string.
3. Split the string into an array of words using space or punctuation as delimiters.
4. Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of words.
5. Iterate through the array of words and increment the counter for each word encountered.
6. Display the total count of words to the user.

You can further enhance the project by adding features such as:

7. Ignoring common words or stop words.
8. Providing statistics like the number of unique words or the frequency of each word.
9. Implementing input validation to handle empty inputs or file errors.
10. Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.

WORD COUNTER

TASK 3

Create a Student class to represent individual students. Include attributes such as name, roll
number, grade, and any other relevant details.
Implement a StudentManagementSystem class to manage the collection of students. Include
methods to add a student, remove a student, search for a student, and display all students.

3 . Design the user interface for the Student Management System. This can be a console-based
interface or a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Swing or JavaFX.

4. Implement methods to read and write student data to a storage medium, such as a file or a
database.

5. Allow users to interact with the Student Management System by providing options such as
adding a new student, editing an existing student's information, searching for a student, displaying all
students, and exiting the application.
6. Implement input validation to ensure that required fields are not left empty and that the student
data is in the correct format
